# React Portfolio

It just so happened that I was learning React right when I wanted to update my online portfolio, so I figured I'd combine those efforts and see what I could come up with!

## Technologies used

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [tsParticles](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles)
- [fullPage](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/react-fullpage)
- [Highlight Cards](https://mui-treasury.com/components/card/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deploying on Google App Engine

From the app's root folder, type:

`npm i`

`npm run build`

Once the build finishes, deploy using:

`gcloud app deploy`
