              I constantly seek opportunities to work on projects that reshape
              how the world will interact with technology in the future. By
              doing research in computer vision and artificial intelligence,
              implementing intuitive teleoperation interfaces for robots and
              designing human-centered features for large-scale software
              platforms, I‚Äôve witnessed first-hand how technology can empower
              people to live more fulfilling lives.
